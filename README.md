# Selective Pesticide & Fertilizer Application for Stormwater Runoff Mitigation

## Project Overview
Stormwater runoff in Virginia, primarily from excess pesticide and fertilizer application, poses significant threats to local ecosystems. This project aims to reduce runoff by creating a machine learning (ML) solution that selectively applies pesticides and fertilizers only when necessary. Using image recognition, this solution identifies plant health and disables application if treatment is unnecessary, optimizing resources and minimizing environmental impact.
